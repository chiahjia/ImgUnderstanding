For part 2 question 4, 5 and 6, the code for these questions were written under q4_q5_q6.py

The image I have provided is called self_img.jpg

All the outputs for the testing are stored under the "output" folder

Before running the code, you will need to change the full path name for your input image at line 12. 

I have separated the code segment for displaying the output for question 4 and question 6 at the end of the python file. You will have to uncomment the that segment to look at the output your desire.
